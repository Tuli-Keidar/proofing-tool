## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Grammar
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 289]
**Original**: "Her experience of tutoring a research and pedagogy subject at Masters level at the University of Western Sydney, using the text Exemplary Teachers of Students in Poverty, heightened her awareness of the importance of cultural sensitivity and inclusivity in early childhood and primary education."
**Issue**: The phrase "at Masters level" should be "at the Master's level" to correctly indicate the level of study.
**Suggestion**: "Her experience of tutoring a research and pedagogy subject at the Master's level at the University of Western Sydney, using the text Exemplary Teachers of Students in Poverty, heightened her awareness of the importance of cultural sensitivity and inclusivity in early childhood and primary education."

### Issue 2: Punctuation
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 293]
**Original**: "Natalie Martino, Senior Consultant  "
**Issue**: There is an extra space after "Consultant."
**Suggestion**: "Natalie Martino, Senior Consultant"

### Issue 3: Clarity
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 296]
**Original**: "This Review evaluated the effectiveness of case management in supporting perpetrators’ engagement with Men’s Behaviour Change Programs."
**Issue**: The word "Review" is unnecessarily capitalised.
**Suggestion**: "This review evaluated the effectiveness of case management in supporting perpetrators’ engagement with Men’s Behaviour Change Programs."

### Issue 4: Repetition
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 303]
**Original**: "She is currently participating in the evaluation of 1800RESPECT and the Domestic, Family, and Sexual Violence Capability Building for Social Responders Project for the for the NSW DCJ Office of Women’s Safety Commissioner."
**Issue**: The phrase "for the" is repeated.
**Suggestion**: "She is currently participating in the evaluation of 1800RESPECT and the Domestic, Family, and Sexual Violence Capability Building for Social Responders Project for the NSW DCJ Office of Women’s Safety Commissioner."

### Issue 5: Consistency
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 305]
**Original**: "Master of Evaluation, University of Melbourne (ongoing, 2026 expected). Graduate Diploma in Political Economy, University of Sydney (2024); Bachelor of International Studies with First Class Honours, University of Wollongong (2020)"
**Issue**: The use of punctuation is inconsistent. A period is used after "2026 expected" but a semicolon is used after "2024."
**Suggestion**: "Master of Evaluation, University of Melbourne (ongoing, 2026 expected); Graduate Diploma in Political Economy, University of Sydney (2024); Bachelor of International Studies with First Class Honours, University of Wollongong (2020)"
