  "feedback": "## Identified Issues\n\n### Issue 1: Clarity\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 13, Row 21, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"Final report - draft\"\n**Issue**: The term \"Final report - draft\" is repeated in both Row 20 and Row 21, which might cause confusion. The term \"draft\" implies that the report is not final, so the phrasing is contradictory.\n**Suggestion**: Consider changing one of the entries to \"Final report - initial draft\" or \"Final report - revised draft\" to clarify the distinction between the two stages.\n\n### Issue 2: Consistency\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 13, Row 23, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"Days by role\"\n**Issue**: The term \"Days by role\" is inconsistent with the previous rows that list specific tasks. It might be clearer to specify the roles or tasks involved.\n**Suggestion**: \"Total days by role\" or specify the roles involved, such as \"Days by Project Manager, Analyst, etc.\"\n\n### Issue 3: Clarity\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 13, Row 24, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"Total fees (excl. GST)\"\n**Issue**: The abbreviation \"GST\" may not be immediately clear to all readers, especially if the document is intended for an international audience.\n**Suggestion**: \"Total fees (excluding Goods and Services Tax)\"\n\n### Issue 4: Consistency\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 13, Row 10, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"Interviews with service providers (6-9)\"\n**Issue**: The numbers in parentheses are unclear. It is not specified whether they refer to the number of interviews or the number of service providers.\n**Suggestion**: \"Interviews with 6-9 service providers\" or \"6-9 interviews with service providers\"\n\n### Issue 5: Consistency\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 13, Row 11, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"Interviews with PMG members (3-5)\"\n**Issue**: Similar to Issue 4, the numbers in parentheses are unclear regarding whether they refer to the number of interviews or PMG members.\n**Suggestion**: \"Interviews with 3-5 PMG members\" or \"3-5 interviews with PMG members\"\n\n### Issue 6: Consistency\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 13, Row 12, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"Interviews with other stakeholders (2-3)\"\n**Issue**: The numbers in parentheses are unclear regarding whether they refer to the number of interviews or stakeholders.\n**Suggestion**: \"Interviews with 2-3 stakeholders\" or \"2-3 interviews with stakeholders\"\n\n### Issue 7: Consistency\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 13, Row 15, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"Interviews with SAWK clients (12-15)\"\n**Issue**: The numbers in parentheses are unclear regarding whether they refer to the number of interviews or SAWK clients.\n**Suggestion**: \"Interviews with 12-15 SAWK clients\" or \"12-15 interviews with SAWK clients\"\n\nNo issues found in other sections.",
