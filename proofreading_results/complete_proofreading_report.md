## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Spelling and Terminology Consistency
**Location**: [Paragraph 6]
**Original**: "acknowledgment"
**Issue**: The document uses "acknowledgment" in one instance and "acknowledgement" in another. Australian English typically uses "acknowledgement."
**Suggestion**: "acknowledgement"

### Issue 2: Redundant Repetition
**Location**: [Paragraph 10] and [Paragraph 11]
**Original**: "Service provider’s details"
**Issue**: The same heading is repeated consecutively without any apparent reason.
**Suggestion**: Remove one instance of "Service provider’s details" to avoid redundancy.

### Issue 3: Inconsistent List Numbering
**Location**: [Paragraph 21 (List item)] to [Paragraph 24 (List item)]
**Original**: "1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4"
**Issue**: The numbering format is inconsistent with the main list, which uses whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3). Subsections should be clearly distinguished from main sections.
**Suggestion**: Ensure consistent formatting by using "1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4" as subsections under the main section "1."

### Issue 4: Missing Section Number
**Location**: [Paragraph 36 (List item)]
**Original**: "5.2 Referees"
**Issue**: There is no "5.1" listed, which suggests a missing section or numbering error.
**Suggestion**: Check for a missing section or correct the numbering to ensure logical flow.

### Issue 5: Unclear Phrase
**Location**: [Paragraph 73]
**Original**: "Presenting key findings to discuss interpretations and implications before reporting means we can present reports that are not only grounded in the evidence but are accepted by key stakeholders and are actionable."
**Issue**: The sentence is lengthy and could be clearer with better punctuation.
**Suggestion**: "By presenting key findings to discuss interpretations and implications before reporting, we ensure our reports are grounded in evidence, accepted by key stakeholders, and actionable."

### Issue 6: Incorrect Use of Apostrophe
**Location**: [Paragraph 80]
**Original**: "ARTD is a leading public policy consulting firm. Our core business is working with government agencies and non-government organisations to deliver comprehensive program evaluation services, providing robust evidence to inform policy decisions, co-design service models and delivery strategies, track outcomes, and continuously improve performance."
**Issue**: The phrase "co-design service models and delivery strategies" lacks parallel structure.
**Suggestion**: "co-designing service models and delivery strategies"

### Issue 7: Missing Comma
**Location**: [Paragraph 82]
**Original**: "We bring a deep understanding of the challenges faced by organisations providing services to individuals impacted by DFV gained through numerous projects for State and Commonwealth governments and non-government organisations."
**Issue**: The sentence is missing a comma after "DFV" to separate clauses.
**Suggestion**: "We bring a deep understanding of the challenges faced by organisations providing services to individuals impacted by DFV, gained through numerous projects for State and Commonwealth governments and non-government organisations."

### Issue 8: Inconsistent Capitalisation
**Location**: [Our understanding of the services required → The program → Paragraph 110]
**Original**: "Legal Services Commission of SA, which contributes free legal information, advice and education:"
**Issue**: The colon at the end of the sentence is unnecessary and inconsistent with other list items.
**Suggestion**: Remove the colon at the end of the sentence.

### Issue 9: Redundant Phrase
**Location**: [Our understanding of the services required → The evaluation → Paragraph 124]
**Original**: "The evaluator will be required to identify or develop data collection tools and methods (both qualitative and quantitative) appropriate for SAWK clients, staff and other stakeholders; prepare and submit an application to a suitable Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) as required; analyse program data and track against service delivery and outcome frameworks; synthesise data from all sources and present findings clearly in a final report."
**Issue**: The phrase "both qualitative and quantitative" is redundant as it is already implied by "data collection tools and methods."
**Suggestion**: "The evaluator will be required to identify or develop data collection tools and methods appropriate for SAWK clients, staff and other stakeholders; prepare and submit an application to a suitable Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) as required; analyse program data and track against service delivery and outcome frameworks; synthesise data from all sources and present findings clearly in a final report."

### Issue 1: [Clarity]
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 6, Row 3, Column 3]
**Original**: "14 April 2025 (or one month after project start date)"
**Issue**: The phrase "or one month after project start date" introduces ambiguity. It is unclear whether the completion date is fixed or dependent on the project start date.

### Issue 3: [Consistency]

### Issue 4: [Clarity]
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 7, Row 6, Column 4]
**Original**: "Analyst"
**Issue**: The position title "Analyst" is inconsistent with the other titles in the table, which are more specific (e.g., Director, Manager, Consultant). It may cause confusion about the role's equivalence.
**Suggestion**: If "Analyst" is correct, ensure it is understood as a distinct role. If it should match the others, consider using "Consultant" or another appropriate title.

### Issue 5: [Consistency]
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 8, Row 4, Column 2]

### Issue 2: Clarity
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 11, Row 3, Column 2]

### Issue 5: Clarity
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 11, Row 6, Column 2]

### Issue 3: Calculation Error
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 12, Row 6, Column 5]
**Original**: "$149,959"
**Issue**: The sub-total for "Price by stage" should be the sum of the individual prices by stage. The correct sum of $38,796, $37,468, $45,576, and $28,119 is $149,959, which is correct. However, the GST calculation in Row 7 should be verified.
**Suggestion**: No change needed for this row, but verify GST calculation.

### Issue 4: Calculation Error
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 12, Row 7, Column 5]
**Original**: "$14,996"
**Issue**: The GST should be 10% of the sub-total in Row 6, Column 5. 10% of $149,959 is $14,995.90, which rounds to $14,996. This is correct.
**Suggestion**: No change needed, but ensure rounding is consistent.

### Issue 5: Calculation Error
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 12, Row 8, Column 5]
**Original**: "$164,955"
**Issue**: The "Price incl. GST" should be the sum of the sub-total and GST. The sum of $149,959 and $14,996 is $164,955, which is correct.
**Suggestion**: No change needed.

### Issue 6: Clarity in Table Heading
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 12]
**Original**: "Price by stage"
**Issue**: The heading "Price by stage" in Column 5 could be clearer by specifying that it includes both fees and expenses.
**Suggestion**: "Total Price by Stage (Fees + Expenses)"

### Issue 7: Clarity in Sub-total Label
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 12, Row 6, Column 1]
**Original**: "Sub-totals"
**Issue**: The label "Sub-totals" could be clearer by specifying what it is summing.
**Suggestion**: "Sub-totals (Days, Fees, Expenses, Price by Stage)"

### Sections Included
- Value for money → Variations → Table 13

### Feedback

## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Clarity
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 21, Column 2]
**Original**: "Final report - draft"
**Issue**: The term "Final report - draft" is repeated in both Row 20 and Row 21, which might cause confusion. The term "draft" implies that the report is not final, so the phrasing is contradictory.
**Suggestion**: Consider changing one of the entries to "Final report - initial draft" or "Final report - revised draft" to clarify the distinction between the two stages.

### Issue 2: Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 23, Column 2]
**Original**: "Days by role"
**Issue**: The term "Days by role" is inconsistent with the previous rows that list specific tasks. It might be clearer to specify the roles or tasks involved.
**Suggestion**: "Total days by role" or specify the roles involved, such as "Days by Project Manager, Analyst, etc."

### Issue 3: Clarity
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 24, Column 2]
**Original**: "Total fees (excl. GST)"
**Issue**: The abbreviation "GST" may not be immediately clear to all readers, especially if the document is intended for an international audience.
**Suggestion**: "Total fees (excluding Goods and Services Tax)"

### Issue 4: Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 10, Column 2]
**Original**: "Interviews with service providers (6-9)"
**Issue**: The numbers in parentheses are unclear. It is not specified whether they refer to the number of interviews or the number of service providers.
**Suggestion**: "Interviews with 6-9 service providers" or "6-9 interviews with service providers"

### Issue 5: Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 11, Column 2]
**Original**: "Interviews with PMG members (3-5)"
**Issue**: Similar to Issue 4, the numbers in parentheses are unclear regarding whether they refer to the number of interviews or PMG members.
**Suggestion**: "Interviews with 3-5 PMG members" or "3-5 interviews with PMG members"

### Issue 6: Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 12, Column 2]
**Original**: "Interviews with other stakeholders (2-3)"
**Issue**: The numbers in parentheses are unclear regarding whether they refer to the number of interviews or stakeholders.
**Suggestion**: "Interviews with 2-3 stakeholders" or "2-3 interviews with stakeholders"

### Issue 7: Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 15, Column 2]
**Original**: "Interviews with SAWK clients (12-15)"
**Issue**: The numbers in parentheses are unclear regarding whether they refer to the number of interviews or SAWK clients.
**Suggestion**: "Interviews with 12-15 SAWK clients" or "12-15 interviews with SAWK clients"

## Segment 18

### Sections Included
- Value for money → Variations → Table 14

### Feedback

## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Clarity and Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 14, Row 6, Column 2]
**Original**: "Vouchers; travel and accommodation for two ARTD staff members; payment for Aboriginal co-researcher for 2-3 interviews"
**Issue**: The use of semicolons here is inconsistent with the rest of the document, which uses commas for similar lists. Additionally, "2-3" should be written out for consistency with the rest of the document.
**Suggestion**: "Vouchers, travel and accommodation for two ARTD staff members, payment for Aboriginal co-researcher for two to three interviews"

### Issue 2: Clarity and Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 14, Row 7, Column 2]
**Original**: "Input from associates, including recruitment of Aboriginal co-researcher and Aboriginal advisory group; travel and accommodation for Paula Shaw; payment for Aboriginal co-researcher"
**Issue**: The use of semicolons is inconsistent with the rest of the document. Additionally, it is unclear if "Aboriginal advisory group" is a separate item or part of the recruitment process.
**Suggestion**: "Input from associates, including the recruitment of an Aboriginal co-researcher and an Aboriginal advisory group, travel and accommodation for Paula Shaw, payment for Aboriginal co-researcher"

### Issue 3: Clarity
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 14, Row 8, Column 2]
**Original**: "Input from associates; input from Aboriginal co-researcher"
**Issue**: The semicolon is unnecessary and could be replaced with a conjunction for clarity.
**Suggestion**: "Input from associates and Aboriginal co-researcher"

### Issue 4: Consistency in Terminology
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 14, Row 12, Column 1]
**Original**: "Expenses incl. GST"
**Issue**: The abbreviation "incl." should be consistent with the rest of the document, which uses full words.
**Suggestion**: "Expenses including GST"

### Issue 5: Potential Factual Error
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 14, Row 12, Column 3]
**Original**: "$21,418"
**Issue**: The total expenses including GST should be verified to ensure accuracy. The sum of the sub-total ($19,471) and GST ($1,947) should be $21,418, which is correct. However, always double-check calculations in financial documents.
**Suggestion**: Ensure the calculation is correct: $19,471 + $1,947 = $21,418
