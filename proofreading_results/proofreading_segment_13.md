## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: [Clarity]
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 6, Row 3, Column 3]
**Original**: "14 April 2025 (or one month after project start date)"
**Issue**: The phrase "or one month after project start date" introduces ambiguity. It is unclear whether the completion date is fixed or dependent on the project start date.
**Suggestion**: "14 April 2025 (or one month after the project start date, whichever is later)"

### Issue 2: [Clarity]
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 6, Row 5, Column 1]
**Original**: "Project protocol, submit application to a suitable HREC"
**Issue**: The phrase "submit application to a suitable HREC" could be clearer if rephrased to indicate the action more directly.
**Suggestion**: "Develop project protocol and submit the application to a suitable Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC)"

### Issue 3: [Consistency]
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 6, Row 7, Column 3]
**Original**: "14 October 2025*"
**Issue**: The asterisk (*) is used without explanation. It should be clarified or removed if unnecessary.
**Suggestion**: "14 October 2025" (If the asterisk is meant to indicate a note, ensure the note is included elsewhere in the document.)

### Issue 4: [Clarity]
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 7, Row 6, Column 4]
**Original**: "Analyst"
**Issue**: The position title "Analyst" is inconsistent with the other titles in the table, which are more specific (e.g., Director, Manager, Consultant). It may cause confusion about the role's equivalence.
**Suggestion**: If "Analyst" is correct, ensure it is understood as a distinct role. If it should match the others, consider using "Consultant" or another appropriate title.

### Issue 5: [Consistency]
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 8, Row 4, Column 2]
**Original**: "Prototype Domestic Family Violence Data Collection"
**Issue**: The term "Domestic Family Violence" is not a standard term and may cause confusion. Typically, "Domestic and Family Violence" is used.
**Suggestion**: "Prototype Domestic and Family Violence Data Collection"

### Issue 6: [Clarity]
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 8, Row 5, Column 2]
**Original**: "Paula Shaw, Dr Stephanie Quail"
**Issue**: The titles are inconsistent. It is unclear if both individuals should have titles or if only one is correct.
**Suggestion**: "Paula Shaw, Dr Stephanie Quail" (Ensure consistency in title usage, e.g., "Ms Paula Shaw, Dr Stephanie Quail" if applicable.)

### Issue 7: [Punctuation]
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 8, Row 3, Column 2]
**Original**: "02 6249 5008, alexandra.palamara@aihw.gov.au"
**Issue**: The format of the contact details lacks clarity. It would be clearer if separated by a semicolon.
**Suggestion**: "02 6249 5008; alexandra.palamara@aihw.gov.au"
