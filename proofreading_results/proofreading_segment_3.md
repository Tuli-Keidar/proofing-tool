## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Grammar
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 2: Data collection and analysis → Paragraph 202]
**Original**: "Research involving children and adolescents raises specific ethical concerns around their capacity to understand the evaluation, assent and consent, and conflicting interests of parents and children."
**Issue**: The phrase "around their capacity to understand the evaluation, assent and consent, and conflicting interests of parents and children" is awkward and unclear. It is not clear whether "evaluation" refers to the research evaluation or the children's understanding.
**Suggestion**: "Research involving children and adolescents raises specific ethical concerns regarding their capacity to understand the evaluation process, give assent and consent, and manage conflicting interests between parents and children."

### Issue 2: Clarity
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 2: Data collection and analysis → Paragraph 203]
**Original**: "Despite the challenges, we believe that collecting qualitative data directly from program participants will be valuable to obtain a full picture of any effects the program may have had on desired outcomes, document unintended consequences, and provide an opportunity for them to have their say on services they use, to inform possible improvements."
**Issue**: The sentence is long and complex, making it difficult to follow.
**Suggestion**: "Despite the challenges, we believe that collecting qualitative data directly from program participants will be valuable. This data will help us obtain a full picture of any effects the program may have had on desired outcomes, document unintended consequences, and provide participants with an opportunity to express their views on the services they use, informing possible improvements."

### Issue 3: Consistency
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 2: Data collection and analysis → Paragraph 204]
**Original**: "Depending on logistics and participant preferences, interviews may be conducted face-to-face (e.g., at the service provider premises, if several interviews can be arranged to occur consecutively over a period of two days) or via Teams/Zoom or phone."
**Issue**: The use of "Teams/Zoom" is inconsistent with the rest of the document, which should maintain a consistent style for listing options.
**Suggestion**: "Depending on logistics and participant preferences, interviews may be conducted face-to-face (e.g., at the service provider premises, if several interviews can be arranged to occur consecutively over a period of two days), via Teams or Zoom, or by phone."

### Issue 4: Grammar
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 2: Data collection and analysis → Paragraph 205]
**Original**: "We would suggest applying to Bellberry regarding the interviews, with a second application to the Aboriginal Health Research Ethics Committee to cover any interviews with Aboriginal families (and the consultations with First Nations group, described below)."
**Issue**: The phrase "First Nations group" should be plural to match "consultations."
**Suggestion**: "We would suggest applying to Bellberry regarding the interviews, with a second application to the Aboriginal Health Research Ethics Committee to cover any interviews with Aboriginal families (and the consultations with First Nations groups, described below)."

### Issue 5: Punctuation
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 2: Data collection and analysis → Paragraph 206]
**Original**: "Informed consent to be contacted will be requested using a straightforward, easy-read participant information sheet."
**Issue**: The term "easy-read" should be hyphenated as "easy-to-read" for clarity.
**Suggestion**: "Informed consent to be contacted will be requested using a straightforward, easy-to-read participant information sheet."

### Issue 6: Punctuation
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 4: Synthesis and final reporting → Paragraph 227]
**Original**: "The sensemaking workshop will give us the opportunity to discuss interpretation of findings and their implications before delivering the draft written report."
**Issue**: The term "sensemaking" is typically hyphenated as "sense-making."
**Suggestion**: "The sense-making workshop will give us the opportunity to discuss interpretation of findings and their implications before delivering the draft written report."

### Issue 7: Consistency
**Location**: [Methodology → Timetable and deliverables → Paragraph 237]
**Original**: "This is based on an assumed start date of Monday, 3 March 2025."
**Issue**: The date format should be consistent with Australian style, which typically uses "3rd March 2025."
**Suggestion**: "This is based on an assumed start date of Monday, 3rd March 2025."

### Issue 8: Consistency
**Location**: [Methodology → Timetable and deliverables → Paragraph 239]
**Original**: "Note. *This timing assumes that data collection from clients can begin in August, allowing three months for ethics approval."
**Issue**: The use of "Note." should be followed by a colon for consistency with typical formatting.
**Suggestion**: "Note: *This timing assumes that data collection from clients can begin in August, allowing three months for ethics approval."
