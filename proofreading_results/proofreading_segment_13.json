  "feedback": "## Identified Issues\n\n### Issue 1: [Clarity]\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 6, Row 3, Column 3]\n**Original**: \"14 April 2025 (or one month after project start date)\"\n**Issue**: The phrase \"or one month after project start date\" introduces ambiguity. It is unclear whether the completion date is fixed or dependent on the project start date.\n**Suggestion**: \"14 April 2025 (or one month after the project start date, whichever is later)\"\n\n### Issue 2: [Clarity]\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 6, Row 5, Column 1]\n**Original**: \"Project protocol, submit application to a suitable HREC\"\n**Issue**: The phrase \"submit application to a suitable HREC\" could be clearer if rephrased to indicate the action more directly.\n**Suggestion**: \"Develop project protocol and submit the application to a suitable Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC)\"\n\n### Issue 3: [Consistency]\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 6, Row 7, Column 3]\n**Original**: \"14 October 2025*\"\n**Issue**: The asterisk (*) is used without explanation. It should be clarified or removed if unnecessary.\n**Suggestion**: \"14 October 2025\" (If the asterisk is meant to indicate a note, ensure the note is included elsewhere in the document.)\n\n### Issue 4: [Clarity]\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 7, Row 6, Column 4]\n**Original**: \"Analyst\"\n**Issue**: The position title \"Analyst\" is inconsistent with the other titles in the table, which are more specific (e.g., Director, Manager, Consultant). It may cause confusion about the role's equivalence.\n**Suggestion**: If \"Analyst\" is correct, ensure it is understood as a distinct role. If it should match the others, consider using \"Consultant\" or another appropriate title.\n\n### Issue 5: [Consistency]\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 8, Row 4, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"Prototype Domestic Family Violence Data Collection\"\n**Issue**: The term \"Domestic Family Violence\" is not a standard term and may cause confusion. Typically, \"Domestic and Family Violence\" is used.\n**Suggestion**: \"Prototype Domestic and Family Violence Data Collection\"\n\n### Issue 6: [Clarity]\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 8, Row 5, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"Paula Shaw, Dr Stephanie Quail\"\n**Issue**: The titles are inconsistent. It is unclear if both individuals should have titles or if only one is correct.\n**Suggestion**: \"Paula Shaw, Dr Stephanie Quail\" (Ensure consistency in title usage, e.g., \"Ms Paula Shaw, Dr Stephanie Quail\" if applicable.)\n\n### Issue 7: [Punctuation]\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 8, Row 3, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"02 6249 5008, alexandra.palamara@aihw.gov.au\"\n**Issue**: The format of the contact details lacks clarity. It would be clearer if separated by a semicolon.\n**Suggestion**: \"02 6249 5008; alexandra.palamara@aihw.gov.au\"\n\nNo issues found in other sections.",
