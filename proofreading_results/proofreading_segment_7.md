## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Spelling and Typographical Error
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 318]
**Original**: "Sue's research projects include an exploration of a shared heath care model..."
**Issue**: The word "heath" is a typographical error and should be "health."
**Suggestion**: "Sue's research projects include an exploration of a shared health care model..."

### Issue 2: Article Usage
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 318]
**Original**: "...the cultural and language translation of the a universally available alcohol and drug screening tool..."
**Issue**: There is an unnecessary repetition of the article "the" before "a universally available."
**Suggestion**: "...the cultural and language translation of a universally available alcohol and drug screening tool..."

### Issue 3: Consistency in Terminology
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 318]
**Original**: "...the piloting an evaluation of culturally adapted Cognitive Behaviour Therapy program..."
**Issue**: The phrase "the piloting an evaluation" is awkward and inconsistent. It should be "the piloting and evaluation."
**Suggestion**: "...the piloting and evaluation of a culturally adapted Cognitive Behaviour Therapy program..."

### Issue 4: Consistency in Terminology
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 326]
**Original**: "...consulting with jurisdictional FDSV policy representatives, as well as sector peak and advocacy bodies..."
**Issue**: The acronym "FDSV" is used here without prior definition. It should be consistent with "DFV" (Domestic and Family Violence) used earlier.
**Suggestion**: "...consulting with jurisdictional DFV policy representatives, as well as sector peak and advocacy bodies..."

### Issue 5: Punctuation
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 328]
**Original**: "Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults, International House, Sydney, 1999 Bachelor of Arts (Anthropology), University of Queensland, 1997"
**Issue**: There is a missing punctuation mark between the two qualifications.
**Suggestion**: "Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults, International House, Sydney, 1999; Bachelor of Arts (Anthropology), University of Queensland, 1997"

### Issue 6: Pronoun Consistency
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 312]
**Original**: "Kate has been recognised for their excellence in health research..."
**Issue**: The pronoun "their" is inconsistent with the singular subject "Kate." It should be "her" to maintain consistency.
**Suggestion**: "Kate has been recognised for her excellence in health research..."

### Issue 7: Clarity and Consistency
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 318]
**Original**: "...the piloting an evaluation of culturally adapted Cognitive Behaviour Therapy program..."
**Issue**: The phrase is missing an article before "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy program."
**Suggestion**: "...the piloting and evaluation of a culturally adapted Cognitive Behaviour Therapy program..."

### Issue 8: Consistency in Capitalisation
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 310]
**Original**: "...chiefly in the wellbeing and mental health domain."
**Issue**: The term "wellbeing" is sometimes hyphenated in Australian English as "well-being."
**Suggestion**: "...chiefly in the well-being and mental health domain."

### Issue 9: Clarity and Redundancy
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 331]
**Original**: "We have an allocated back-up for key team members should any unforeseen circumstances arise or should we need to draw on extra capacity to deliver the project because of changes to scope or timing."
**Issue**: The phrase "should any unforeseen circumstances arise or should we need to draw on extra capacity" is slightly redundant and could be simplified for clarity.
**Suggestion**: "We have an allocated back-up for key team members in case of unforeseen circumstances or the need for extra capacity due to changes in scope or timing."
