## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Grammar
**Location**: [Cultural experience → Paragraph 421]
**Original**: "We recognise that different stakeholder groups have different interests and perspectives on how a service is working, and any changes that are needed."
**Issue**: The sentence is slightly awkward due to the placement of "and any changes that are needed." It could be clearer.
**Suggestion**: "We recognise that different stakeholder groups have different interests and perspectives on how a service is working and on any changes that are needed."

### Issue 2: Clarity
**Location**: [Cultural experience → Paragraph 422]
**Original**: "Recent projects we have facilitated stakeholder consultations and forums include:"
**Issue**: The sentence is missing a verb or conjunction to connect the elements properly.
**Suggestion**: "Recent projects where we have facilitated stakeholder consultations and forums include:"

### Issue 3: Consistency
**Location**: [Cultural experience → Paragraph 424]
**Original**: "Strategic Plan for the Coronial Jurisdiction of NSW (Departments of Communities and Justice, 2023)"
**Issue**: "Departments of Communities and Justice" should be consistent with other mentions, which use "Department."
**Suggestion**: "Strategic Plan for the Coronial Jurisdiction of NSW (Department of Communities and Justice, 2023)"

### Issue 4: Consistency
**Location**: [Cultural experience → Paragraph 425]
**Original**: "Strategic Plan for Children’s Court of NSW (Departments of Communities and Justice, 2023)"
**Issue**: Same as Issue 3, "Departments" should be "Department" for consistency.
**Suggestion**: "Strategic Plan for Children’s Court of NSW (Department of Communities and Justice, 2023)"

### Issue 5: Consistency
**Location**: [Cultural experience → Paragraph 428]
**Original**: "Strategic Plan for Local Court of NSW (Departments of Communities and Justice, current)"
**Issue**: Same as Issue 3, "Departments" should be "Department" for consistency.
**Suggestion**: "Strategic Plan for Local Court of NSW (Department of Communities and Justice, current)"

### Issue 6: Punctuation
**Location**: [Risk management and quality assurance → Project management and quality standards → Paragraph 440]
**Original**: "In relation to this project, the ARTD Partners will enter into a contract with you, our client, on the basis that:"
**Issue**: The colon at the end of the sentence suggests a list or explanation follows, which is correct, but the formatting of the subsequent points should be consistent with list formatting.
**Suggestion**: Ensure the list items following this sentence are formatted consistently as bullet points or numbered items.

### Issue 7: Clarity
**Location**: [Risk management and quality assurance → Project management and quality standards → Paragraph 442]
**Original**: "In the normal course of events, we expect that if your agency has any issues or concerns about the project, these will be raised, in the first instance, with the ARTD project manager."
**Issue**: The phrase "in the first instance" is somewhat redundant and can be simplified.
**Suggestion**: "Normally, we expect that if your agency has any issues or concerns about the project, these will be raised with the ARTD project manager."

### Issue 8: Grammar
**Location**: [Risk management and quality assurance → Project management and quality standards → Paragraph 448]
**Original**: "We encourage our clients to make a formal complaint if they believe ARTD is not meeting its contractual obligations or there is a significant risk that the client’s requirements for the project will not be met."
**Issue**: The sentence is correct but could be clearer by separating the two conditions.
**Suggestion**: "We encourage our clients to make a formal complaint if they believe ARTD is not meeting its contractual obligations, or if there is a significant risk that the client’s requirements for the project will not be met."

### Issue 9: Punctuation
**Location**: [Risk management and quality assurance → Project management and quality standards → Paragraph 450]
**Original**: "Our consultants are members of the Australian Evaluation Society and all of our projects are conducted within the Australian Evaluation Society’s Guidelines for the Ethical Conduct of Evaluations, the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research, 2007, and the Ethical Considerations in Quality Assurance and Evaluation Activities."
**Issue**: The list of guidelines is punctuated with commas, which can be confusing. Semicolons would be clearer.
**Suggestion**: "Our consultants are members of the Australian Evaluation Society, and all of our projects are conducted within the Australian Evaluation Society’s Guidelines for the Ethical Conduct of Evaluations; the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research, 2007; and the Ethical Considerations in Quality Assurance and Evaluation Activities."

### Issue 10: Clarity
**Location**: [Risk management and quality assurance → Project management and quality standards → Paragraph 452]
**Original**: "We are fully aware of ethical issues, such as maintaining confidentiality, and communicating sensitively and in a culturally appropriate manner."
**Issue**: The sentence structure is slightly awkward due to the placement of "such as."
**Suggestion**: "We are fully aware of ethical issues, including maintaining confidentiality and communicating sensitively and in a culturally appropriate manner."

### Issue 11: Punctuation
**Location**: [Risk management and quality assurance → Project management and quality standards → Paragraph 454]
**Original**: "Information sheets include contact details of ARTD staff, so participants can ask questions before agreeing to participate."
**Issue**: The comma is unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the sentence.
**Suggestion**: "Information sheets include contact details of ARTD staff so participants can ask questions before agreeing to participate."

### Issue 12: Clarity
**Location**: [Risk management and quality assurance → Project management and quality standards → Paragraph 455]
**Original**: "make sure that people are not coerced into participating in the evaluation, by briefing program providers on the consent process to make sure verbal explanations make clear that people can opt out if they wish or choose not to answer certain questions."
**Issue**: The sentence is lengthy and repetitive, particularly the use of "make sure."
**Suggestion**: "ensure that people are not coerced into participating in the evaluation by briefing program providers on the consent process, clarifying that people can opt out if they wish or choose not to answer certain questions."
