Semicolons would be clearer.\n**Suggestion**: \"Our consultants are members of the Australian Evaluation Society, and all of our projects are conducted within the Australian Evaluation Society\u2019s Guidelines for the Ethical Conduct of Evaluations; the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research, 2007; and the Ethical Considerations in Quality Assurance and Evaluation Activities.\"\n\n### Issue 10: Clarity\n**Location**: [Risk management and quality assurance \u2192 Project management and quality standards \u2192 Paragraph 452]\n**Original**: \"We are fully aware of ethical issues, such as maintaining confidentiality, and communicating sensitively and in a culturally appropriate manner.\"\n**Issue**: The sentence structure is slightly awkward due to the placement of \"such as.\"\n**Suggestion**: \"We are fully aware of ethical issues, including maintaining confidentiality and communicating sensitively and in a culturally appropriate manner.\"\n\n### Issue 11: Punctuation\n**Location**: [Risk management and quality assurance \u2192 Project management and quality standards \u2192 Paragraph 454]\n**Original**: \"Information sheets include contact details of ARTD staff, so participants can ask questions before agreeing to participate.\"\n**Issue**: The comma is unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the sentence.\n**Suggestion**: \"Information sheets include contact details of ARTD staff so participants can ask questions before agreeing to participate.\"\n\n### Issue 12: Clarity\n**Location**: [Risk management and quality assurance \u2192 Project management and quality standards \u2192 Paragraph 455]\n**Original**: \"make sure that people are not coerced into participating in the evaluation, by briefing program providers on the consent process to make sure verbal explanations make clear that people can opt out if they wish or choose not to answer certain questions.\"\n**Issue**: The sentence is lengthy and repetitive, particularly the use of \"make sure.\"\n**Suggestion**: \"ensure that people are not coerced into participating in the evaluation by briefing program providers on the consent process, clarifying that people can opt out if they wish or choose not to answer certain questions.\"\n\nNo issues found in the \"Referees\" section.",
