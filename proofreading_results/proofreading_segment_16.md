## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Clarity
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 21, Column 2]
**Original**: "Final report - draft"
**Issue**: The term "Final report - draft" is repeated in both Row 20 and Row 21, which might cause confusion. The term "draft" implies that the report is not final, so the phrasing is contradictory.
**Suggestion**: Consider changing one of the entries to "Final report - initial draft" or "Final report - revised draft" to clarify the distinction between the two stages.

### Issue 2: Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 23, Column 2]
**Original**: "Days by role"
**Issue**: The term "Days by role" is inconsistent with the previous rows that list specific tasks. It might be clearer to specify the roles or tasks involved.
**Suggestion**: "Total days by role" or specify the roles involved, such as "Days by Project Manager, Analyst, etc."

### Issue 3: Clarity
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 24, Column 2]
**Original**: "Total fees (excl. GST)"
**Issue**: The abbreviation "GST" may not be immediately clear to all readers, especially if the document is intended for an international audience.
**Suggestion**: "Total fees (excluding Goods and Services Tax)"

### Issue 4: Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 10, Column 2]
**Original**: "Interviews with service providers (6-9)"
**Issue**: The numbers in parentheses are unclear. It is not specified whether they refer to the number of interviews or the number of service providers.
**Suggestion**: "Interviews with 6-9 service providers" or "6-9 interviews with service providers"

### Issue 5: Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 11, Column 2]
**Original**: "Interviews with PMG members (3-5)"
**Issue**: Similar to Issue 4, the numbers in parentheses are unclear regarding whether they refer to the number of interviews or PMG members.
**Suggestion**: "Interviews with 3-5 PMG members" or "3-5 interviews with PMG members"

### Issue 6: Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 12, Column 2]
**Original**: "Interviews with other stakeholders (2-3)"
**Issue**: The numbers in parentheses are unclear regarding whether they refer to the number of interviews or stakeholders.
**Suggestion**: "Interviews with 2-3 stakeholders" or "2-3 interviews with stakeholders"

### Issue 7: Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Table 13, Row 15, Column 2]
**Original**: "Interviews with SAWK clients (12-15)"
**Issue**: The numbers in parentheses are unclear regarding whether they refer to the number of interviews or SAWK clients.
**Suggestion**: "Interviews with 12-15 SAWK clients" or "12-15 interviews with SAWK clients"
