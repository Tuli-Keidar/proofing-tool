### Issue 1: [Grammar]
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 268]
**Original**: "This gives her additional insight to the decision-making challenges facing policy makers and administrators, as well as their information needs."
**Issue**: The phrase "insight to" should be "insight into" to correctly convey the meaning.

### Issue 2: [Consistency]

**Issue**: The list of clients includes both "Paul Ramsay Foundation" and "eSafety Commissioner" without the definite article "the," which is inconsistent with the rest of the list.
**Suggestion**: "Her clients have included the National Mental Health Commission, the NSW Ministry of Health, the Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care, Lifeline Australia, the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, Mission Australia, the Paul Ramsay Foundation, the eSafety Commissioner, various Primary Health Networks, and many other agencies and organisations."

**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 283]
