## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Grammar
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capability → Paragraph 252]
**Original**: "managers, staff and clients A collaborative development approach will help to ensure the evaluation plan is feasible to implement,"
**Issue**: There is a missing punctuation mark (a full stop) between "clients" and "A collaborative development approach."
**Suggestion**: "managers, staff and clients. A collaborative development approach will help to ensure the evaluation plan is feasible to implement,"

### Issue 2: Clarity
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capability → Paragraph 251]
**Original**: "Our team are specialists in data techniques including coding and thematic analysis of qualitative data and advanced statistical analysis of quantitative data."
**Issue**: The subject "team" is singular, so it should be followed by "is" instead of "are."
**Suggestion**: "Our team is specialists in data techniques including coding and thematic analysis of qualitative data and advanced statistical analysis of quantitative data."

### Issue 3: Clarity
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capability → Paragraph 252]
**Original**: "Through the co-design process, the activities required to undertake evaluation will be identified and scoped, with emphasis given to the resources and skills required to implement these activities within the required timeframes."
**Issue**: The sentence is slightly awkward due to the repetition of "required." It could be rephrased for clarity.
**Suggestion**: "Through the co-design process, the activities necessary for undertaking the evaluation will be identified and scoped, with emphasis on the resources and skills needed to implement these activities within the required timeframes."

### Issue 4: Consistency
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capability → Paragraph 257]
**Original**: "If required, we can provide summary and brochure versions or PowerPoint presentations, to communicate findings to wider audiences."
**Issue**: The phrase "summary and brochure versions" is inconsistent in format. It should be "summary versions and brochures" for parallel structure.
**Suggestion**: "If required, we can provide summary versions and brochures or PowerPoint presentations to communicate findings to wider audiences."

### Issue 5: Punctuation
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capability → Paragraph 250]
**Original**: "acknowledge limitations,  and provide strategic recommendations."
**Issue**: There is an extra space after the comma.
**Suggestion**: "acknowledge limitations, and provide strategic recommendations."

**Original**: "With your agreement, the team will be able to draw on the expertise and capacity of other ARTD staff if required – a full list of staff and their CVs is provided on our website www.artd.com.au."
**Issue**: There should be a comma after "website" for clarity.
**Suggestion**: "With your agreement, the team will be able to draw on the expertise and capacity of other ARTD staff if required – a full list of staff and their CVs is provided on our website, www.artd.com.au."

### Issue 7: Clarity
**Location**: [Capability and capacity → Capacity → Paragraph 261]
**Original**: "We have a sophisticated internal project management system that enables us to monitor and adjust staff workloads in advance so we know that our proposed team has the capacity to deliver this work plan and can make sure that they continue to do so throughout the project."
**Issue**: The sentence is lengthy and could be split for better readability.
