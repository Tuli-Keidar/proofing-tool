## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Grammar
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 11, Row 3, Column 1]
**Original**: "The work we do is complex, and timelines are often different than they are in planning."
**Issue**: The phrase "different than" is not standard in Australian English. The correct phrase is "different from."
**Suggestion**: "The work we do is complex, and timelines are often different from what they are in planning."

### Issue 2: Clarity
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 11, Row 3, Column 2]
**Original**: "We will have regular catch-ups with the DHS team to keep you abreast of any required changes in timing."
**Issue**: The use of "catch-ups" might be informal for a professional document. It could be replaced with a more formal term.
**Suggestion**: "We will have regular meetings with the DHS team to keep you informed of any required changes in timing."

### Issue 3: Clarity
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 11, Row 5, Column 2]
**Original**: "We suggest holding an online meeting with participating organisations to introduce the evaluation team and discuss the evaluation should help address any questions or concerns they may have, creating trust and encouraging them to engage in data collection activities."
**Issue**: The sentence structure is awkward and unclear. It needs restructuring for clarity.
**Suggestion**: "We suggest holding an online meeting with participating organisations to introduce the evaluation team and discuss the evaluation. This should help address any questions or concerns they may have, create trust, and encourage them to engage in data collection activities."

### Issue 4: Grammar
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 11, Row 6, Column 2]
**Original**: "ARTD has a team of highly qualified and skilled staff to draw on that, who have the necessary expertise to complete this project."
**Issue**: The phrase "to draw on that, who have" is grammatically incorrect. The relative clause is misplaced.
**Suggestion**: "ARTD has a team of highly qualified and skilled staff who have the necessary expertise to complete this project."

### Issue 5: Clarity
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 11, Row 6, Column 2]
**Original**: "We would fully brief you on any staff changes and seek your permission before any changes were made."
**Issue**: The use of "were" suggests a past action, which is inconsistent with the future context implied by "would." 
**Suggestion**: "We will fully brief you on any staff changes and seek your permission before any changes are made."

### Issue 6: Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 11, Row 5, Column 2]
**Original**: "It is important to emphasise that we are evaluating the program itself and not their services."
**Issue**: The document uses Australian English, so "emphasise" is correct, but ensure consistency in spelling throughout the document.
**Suggestion**: Confirm that "emphasise" is consistently used in the document, as it is correct in Australian English.
