## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Spelling
**Location**: [Relevant experience and past performance → Paragraph 337]
**Original**: "focussed"
**Issue**: The word "focussed" is an alternative spelling; however, "focused" is more commonly used in Australian English.
**Suggestion**: "focused"

### Issue 2: Punctuation
**Location**: [Relevant experience and past performance → Paragraph 337]
**Original**: "Our curiosity and passion for evaluation, means we make the commitment to all our clients to share our evaluation knowledge and expertise, and to learn from you."
**Issue**: The comma after "evaluation" is unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the sentence.
**Suggestion**: "Our curiosity and passion for evaluation means we make the commitment to all our clients to share our evaluation knowledge and expertise, and to learn from you."

### Issue 3: Clarity
**Location**: [Relevant experience and past performance → Paragraph 347]
**Original**: "Our work, across a range of jurisdictions spans the many agencies that intersect with those who experience domestic and family violence and their children, including the civil and criminal courts, the Federal Family Circuit Court of Australia, the child protection system, mental health and associated human services supports, housing and homelessness supports."
**Issue**: The sentence is lengthy and could be split for clarity. The list of agencies is extensive and may benefit from clearer separation.
**Suggestion**: "Our work spans a range of jurisdictions and many agencies that intersect with those who experience domestic and family violence and their children. This includes the civil and criminal courts, the Federal Family Circuit Court of Australia, the child protection system, mental health services, associated human services supports, and housing and homelessness supports."

### Issue 4: Consistency
**Location**: [Relevant experience and past performance → Our experience with conducting evaluations of a similar scope, scale and complexity → Paragraph 364]
**Original**: "Evaluation the Southport Specialist Domestic and Family Violence Court Justice Response"
**Issue**: The phrase "Evaluation the Southport Specialist Domestic and Family Violence Court Justice Response" is missing a preposition.
**Suggestion**: "Evaluation of the Southport Specialist Domestic and Family Violence Court Justice Response"

### Issue 5: Punctuation
**Location**: [Relevant experience and past performance → Our experience with conducting evaluations of a similar scope, scale and complexity → Paragraph 365]
**Original**: "Evaluation of programs for women in contact with the criminal justice system, (including the Sexual Violence Counselling Service)"
**Issue**: The comma before the parenthesis is unnecessary.
**Suggestion**: "Evaluation of programs for women in contact with the criminal justice system (including the Sexual Violence Counselling Service)"

### Issue 6: Grammar
**Location**: [Relevant experience and past performance → Our experience with conducting evaluations of a similar scope, scale and complexity → Paragraph 366]
**Original**: "Evaluation of Safer Pathway (Women NSW, 2019)."
**Issue**: "Safer Pathway" should be "Safer Pathways" for consistency with previous mentions.
**Suggestion**: "Evaluation of Safer Pathways (Women NSW, 2019)."
