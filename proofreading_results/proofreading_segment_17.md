## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Clarity and Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 14, Row 6, Column 2]
**Original**: "Vouchers; travel and accommodation for two ARTD staff members; payment for Aboriginal co-researcher for 2-3 interviews"
**Issue**: The use of semicolons here is inconsistent with the rest of the document, which uses commas for similar lists. Additionally, "2-3" should be written out for consistency with the rest of the document.
**Suggestion**: "Vouchers, travel and accommodation for two ARTD staff members, payment for Aboriginal co-researcher for two to three interviews"

### Issue 2: Clarity and Consistency
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 14, Row 7, Column 2]
**Original**: "Input from associates, including recruitment of Aboriginal co-researcher and Aboriginal advisory group; travel and accommodation for Paula Shaw; payment for Aboriginal co-researcher"
**Issue**: The use of semicolons is inconsistent with the rest of the document. Additionally, it is unclear if "Aboriginal advisory group" is a separate item or part of the recruitment process.
**Suggestion**: "Input from associates, including the recruitment of an Aboriginal co-researcher and an Aboriginal advisory group, travel and accommodation for Paula Shaw, payment for Aboriginal co-researcher"

### Issue 3: Clarity
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 14, Row 8, Column 2]
**Original**: "Input from associates; input from Aboriginal co-researcher"
**Issue**: The semicolon is unnecessary and could be replaced with a conjunction for clarity.
**Suggestion**: "Input from associates and Aboriginal co-researcher"

### Issue 4: Consistency in Terminology
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 14, Row 12, Column 1]
**Original**: "Expenses incl. GST"
**Issue**: The abbreviation "incl." should be consistent with the rest of the document, which uses full words.
**Suggestion**: "Expenses including GST"

### Issue 5: Potential Factual Error
**Location**: [Value for money → Variations → Table 14, Row 12, Column 3]
**Original**: "$21,418"
**Issue**: The total expenses including GST should be verified to ensure accuracy. The sum of the sub-total ($19,471) and GST ($1,947) should be $21,418, which is correct. However, always double-check calculations in financial documents.
**Suggestion**: Ensure the calculation is correct: $19,471 + $1,947 = $21,418
