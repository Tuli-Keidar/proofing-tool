## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Spelling and Terminology Consistency
**Location**: [Paragraph 6]
**Original**: "acknowledgment"
**Issue**: The document uses "acknowledgment" in one instance and "acknowledgement" in another. Australian English typically uses "acknowledgement."
**Suggestion**: "acknowledgement"

### Issue 2: Redundant Repetition
**Location**: [Paragraph 10] and [Paragraph 11]
**Original**: "Service provider’s details"
**Issue**: The same heading is repeated consecutively without any apparent reason.
**Suggestion**: Remove one instance of "Service provider’s details" to avoid redundancy.

### Issue 3: Inconsistent List Numbering
**Location**: [Paragraph 21 (List item)] to [Paragraph 24 (List item)]
**Original**: "1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4"
**Issue**: The numbering format is inconsistent with the main list, which uses whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3). Subsections should be clearly distinguished from main sections.
**Suggestion**: Ensure consistent formatting by using "1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4" as subsections under the main section "1."

### Issue 4: Missing Section Number
**Location**: [Paragraph 36 (List item)]
**Original**: "5.2 Referees"
**Issue**: There is no "5.1" listed, which suggests a missing section or numbering error.
**Suggestion**: Check for a missing section or correct the numbering to ensure logical flow.

### Issue 5: Unclear Phrase
**Location**: [Paragraph 73]
**Original**: "Presenting key findings to discuss interpretations and implications before reporting means we can present reports that are not only grounded in the evidence but are accepted by key stakeholders and are actionable."
**Issue**: The sentence is lengthy and could be clearer with better punctuation.
**Suggestion**: "By presenting key findings to discuss interpretations and implications before reporting, we ensure our reports are grounded in evidence, accepted by key stakeholders, and actionable."

### Issue 6: Incorrect Use of Apostrophe
**Location**: [Paragraph 80]
**Original**: "ARTD is a leading public policy consulting firm. Our core business is working with government agencies and non-government organisations to deliver comprehensive program evaluation services, providing robust evidence to inform policy decisions, co-design service models and delivery strategies, track outcomes, and continuously improve performance."
**Issue**: The phrase "co-design service models and delivery strategies" lacks parallel structure.
**Suggestion**: "co-designing service models and delivery strategies"

### Issue 7: Missing Comma
**Location**: [Paragraph 82]
**Original**: "We bring a deep understanding of the challenges faced by organisations providing services to individuals impacted by DFV gained through numerous projects for State and Commonwealth governments and non-government organisations."
**Issue**: The sentence is missing a comma after "DFV" to separate clauses.
**Suggestion**: "We bring a deep understanding of the challenges faced by organisations providing services to individuals impacted by DFV, gained through numerous projects for State and Commonwealth governments and non-government organisations."

### Issue 8: Inconsistent Capitalisation
**Location**: [Our understanding of the services required → The program → Paragraph 110]
**Original**: "Legal Services Commission of SA, which contributes free legal information, advice and education:"
**Issue**: The colon at the end of the sentence is unnecessary and inconsistent with other list items.
**Suggestion**: Remove the colon at the end of the sentence.

### Issue 9: Redundant Phrase
**Location**: [Our understanding of the services required → The evaluation → Paragraph 124]
**Original**: "The evaluator will be required to identify or develop data collection tools and methods (both qualitative and quantitative) appropriate for SAWK clients, staff and other stakeholders; prepare and submit an application to a suitable Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) as required; analyse program data and track against service delivery and outcome frameworks; synthesise data from all sources and present findings clearly in a final report."
**Issue**: The phrase "both qualitative and quantitative" is redundant as it is already implied by "data collection tools and methods."
**Suggestion**: "The evaluator will be required to identify or develop data collection tools and methods appropriate for SAWK clients, staff and other stakeholders; prepare and submit an application to a suitable Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) as required; analyse program data and track against service delivery and outcome frameworks; synthesise data from all sources and present findings clearly in a final report."
