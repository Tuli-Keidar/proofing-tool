## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Grammar
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 1: Evaluation design and planning → Paragraph 165 (Numbered list)]
**Original**: "Because SAWK is targeted to children and young people who have experienced DFV we feel the clients of the programs are likely to meet the definition of vulnerable and therefore the need for formal review by a HREC is triggered."
**Issue**: The sentence is missing a comma after "DFV" to separate the clauses properly.
**Suggestion**: "Because SAWK is targeted to children and young people who have experienced DFV, we feel the clients of the programs are likely to meet the definition of vulnerable and therefore the need for formal review by a HREC is triggered."

### Issue 2: Clarity
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 1: Evaluation design and planning → Paragraph 167]
**Original**: "The merit and integrity of the proposed project, ensuring that any risks are justifiable by potential benefits, methods are appropriate, the study builds on current knowledge, and appropriate skills, expertise and resources are available"
**Issue**: The sentence is a fragment and lacks a main verb.
**Suggestion**: "We will ensure the merit and integrity of the proposed project by justifying any risks with potential benefits, using appropriate methods, building on current knowledge, and ensuring that appropriate skills, expertise, and resources are available."

### Issue 3: Grammar
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 2: Data collection and analysis → Paragraph 177]
**Original**: "Our team are specialists in data analysis techniques, from coding and thematic analysis of qualitative data and advanced statistical analysis of quantitative data."
**Issue**: "Team" is a collective noun and should be followed by "is" instead of "are."
**Suggestion**: "Our team is specialists in data analysis techniques, from coding and thematic analysis of qualitative data to advanced statistical analysis of quantitative data."

### Issue 4: Clarity
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 2: Data collection and analysis → Paragraph 187]
**Original**: "Stephanie will negotiate with data custodians and service providers to understand data assets and limitations, to facilitate secure transfer and storage, and ensure that the datasets are of high quality and can be accurately analysed and interpreted."
**Issue**: The sentence structure is slightly awkward due to the repetition of "to" before each clause.
**Suggestion**: "Stephanie will negotiate with data custodians and service providers to understand data assets and limitations, facilitate secure transfer and storage, and ensure that the datasets are of high quality and can be accurately analysed and interpreted."

### Issue 5: Punctuation
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 2: Data collection and analysis → Paragraph 190]
**Original**: "In this case, we would seek to interview key representatives from the three partner organisations (Women’s Safety Services SA, Relationships Australia SA, and Legal Services Commission of SA) to understand how they conceptualise and deliver the program, the challenges and enablers for implementation, and what outcomes they would anticipate."
**Issue**: The sentence is missing a comma before "to understand" for better readability.
**Suggestion**: "In this case, we would seek to interview key representatives from the three partner organisations (Women’s Safety Services SA, Relationships Australia SA, and Legal Services Commission of SA), to understand how they conceptualise and deliver the program, the challenges and enablers for implementation, and what outcomes they would anticipate."

### Issue 6: Grammar
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 2: Data collection and analysis → Paragraph 191]
**Original**: "Members of the nominated project team have considerable experience in conducting evaluations in healthcare and human services settings, including interviews and focus groups with service providers, administrators, and managers."
**Issue**: The sentence is correct, but the phrase "considerable experience in conducting evaluations" could be more concise.
**Suggestion**: "Members of the nominated project team have extensive experience conducting evaluations in healthcare and human services settings, including interviews and focus groups with service providers, administrators, and managers."

### Issue 7: Clarity
**Location**: [Methodology → Stage 2: Data collection and analysis → Paragraph 197]
**Original**: "We will adopt a purposive sampling strategy, focusing on stakeholders with greatest knowledge of the program."
**Issue**: The phrase "with greatest knowledge of the program" is slightly awkward.
**Suggestion**: "We will adopt a purposive sampling strategy, focusing on stakeholders who have the greatest knowledge of the program."
