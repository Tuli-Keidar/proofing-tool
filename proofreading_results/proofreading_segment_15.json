  "feedback": "## Identified Issues\n\n### Issue 1: Consistency in Numerical Formatting\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 12, Row 2, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"15.75\"\n**Issue**: The number of days is presented with two decimal places, which is inconsistent with the other rows that use one or no decimal places. Consistency in numerical formatting is important for clarity.\n**Suggestion**: \"15.8\"\n\n### Issue 2: Consistency in Numerical Formatting\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 12, Row 3, Column 2]\n**Original**: \"21.5\"\n**Issue**: The number of days is presented with one decimal place, which is inconsistent with other rows that use no decimal places.\n**Suggestion**: \"22\"\n\n### Issue 3: Calculation Error\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 12, Row 6, Column 5]\n**Original**: \"$149,959\"\n**Issue**: The sub-total for \"Price by stage\" should be the sum of the individual prices by stage. The correct sum of $38,796, $37,468, $45,576, and $28,119 is $149,959, which is correct. However, the GST calculation in Row 7 should be verified.\n**Suggestion**: No change needed for this row, but verify GST calculation.\n\n### Issue 4: Calculation Error\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 12, Row 7, Column 5]\n**Original**: \"$14,996\"\n**Issue**: The GST should be 10% of the sub-total in Row 6, Column 5. 10% of $149,959 is $14,995.90, which rounds to $14,996. This is correct.\n**Suggestion**: No change needed, but ensure rounding is consistent.\n\n### Issue 5: Calculation Error\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 12, Row 8, Column 5]\n**Original**: \"$164,955\"\n**Issue**: The \"Price incl. GST\" should be the sum of the sub-total and GST. The sum of $149,959 and $14,996 is $164,955, which is correct.\n**Suggestion**: No change needed.\n\n### Issue 6: Clarity in Table Heading\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Variations \u2192 Table 12]\n**Original**: \"Price by stage\"\n**Issue**: The heading \"Price by stage\" in Column 5 could be clearer by specifying that it includes both fees and expenses.\n**Suggestion**: \"Total Price by Stage (Fees + Expenses)\"\n\n### Issue 7: Clarity in Sub-total Label\n**Location**: [Value for money \u2192 Table 12, Row 6, Column 1]\n**Original**: \"Sub-totals\"\n**Issue**: The label \"Sub-totals\" could be clearer by specifying what it is summing.\n**Suggestion**: \"Sub-totals (Days, Fees, Expenses, Price by Stage)\"\n\nNo issues found in other sections.",
